# Implementation Plan: Initial Fraud Management UI Implementation

**Branch**: `001-initial-fraud-management` | **Date**: October 22, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-initial-fraud-management/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Primary requirement: Build initial fraud management UI enabling bank staff to submit transaction details (transaction ID and credit card number) and receive immediate fraud risk assessment. Technical approach: Single-page React web application with REST API integration to fraud detection service, implementing GloboBank Design System with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance and credit card input masking.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, React 18.x, Node.js 20.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Next.js 14.x, GloboBank Design System, React Hook Form, Axios, Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress  
**UI Framework**: React 18.x with Next.js 14.x for optimized performance and development experience
**Design System**: GloboBank Design System v1.0+ compliance required for consistent branding and components
**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests (70%), Integration tests (20%), E2E tests (10%) with TDD approach enforced  
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome 100+, Firefox 100+, Safari 15+), mobile-responsive design required
**Project Type**: Single-page web application with fraud detection integration  
**Performance Goals**: Initial load <3s, Time to Interactive <5s, CLS <0.1, fraud assessment response <200ms  
**Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory, screen reader support, keyboard navigation
**Security Requirements**: Initial implementation open access, future OAuth 2.0 + PKCE, input validation, credit card masking
**Fraud Integration**: REST API integration with fraud detection service at `/fraud/v1/risk-assessments` endpoint  
**Scale/Scope**: Support minimum 100 concurrent users, process fraud assessments within 200ms response time

## Constitution Check
