# Feature Specification: Initial Fraud Management UI Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-initial-fraud-management`  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "initial-fraud-management-ui-implementation"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: How will the UI communicate with the fraud detection platform? → A: External API endpoint (fraud detection service provides dedicated REST endpoint for this UI)
- Q: When the fraud detection service is unavailable, how should the UI handle this failure scenario? → A: Show generic error message and log details for support
- Q: How long should fraud assessment results remain visible on screen before clearing? → A: Results remain visible (future feature will add auto-clear)
- Q: What should the user interface layout be for this initial implementation? → A: Only one fraud verification form per page
- Q: Should credit card numbers be masked during input or only after submission? → A: Mask during input and after submission

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Transaction Fraud Verification (Priority: P1)

Bank staff can submit transaction details (transaction ID and credit card number) and receive immediate fraud risk verification to make critical business decisions about transaction approval.

**Why this priority**: Core business function enabling immediate fraud detection and financial loss prevention. This is the minimum viable product that delivers immediate business value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a valid transaction ID and credit card number, and verifying that a clear fraud status (fraudulent/not fraudulent) is returned within 200ms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid transaction ID (UUID format) and credit card number, **When** user submits fraud verification request, **Then** system returns clear fraud risk status (fraudulent/not fraudulent)
2. **Given** a known fraudulent credit card number, **When** user submits verification request, **Then** system identifies and reports the transaction as fraudulent
3. **Given** system is processing request, **When** fraud assessment is in progress, **Then** user sees loading indicator and receives immediate visual feedback when processing is complete

### User Story 2 - GloboBank Brand Experience (Priority: P2)

Users experience consistent GloboBank branding while accessing fraud detection capabilities, reinforcing brand trust and professional service delivery.

**Why this priority**: Brand consistency builds user confidence in fraud detection services and maintains professional corporate identity. Essential for business credibility but not core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the fraud detection interface and verifying GloboBank brand banner is prominently displayed with consistent branding.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses fraud detection interface, **When** page loads, **Then** GloboBank brand banner is prominently displayed
2. **Given** user interacts with fraud detection form, **When** using interface features, **Then** all elements maintain consistent GloboBank branding and design system compliance

---

### User Story 3 - Data Input Validation (Priority: P3)

Users receive clear feedback when entering invalid transaction data, ensuring data quality for fraud verification processing.

**Why this priority**: Operational efficiency and data quality are important but secondary to core fraud detection functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid data formats and verifying appropriate error messages are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user enters invalid transaction ID format, **When** form validation occurs, **Then** system provides clear error messaging for UUID format requirement
2. **Given** user enters invalid credit card number, **When** validation occurs, **Then** system displays error message for Luhn algorithm validation failure
3. **Given** user submits empty form fields, **When** attempting submission, **Then** system prevents submission and highlights required fields

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the fraud detection backend service is unavailable during transaction verification? System displays generic error message to user and logs detailed error information for support team investigation.
- How does the interface handle network timeout scenarios when fraud processing exceeds 200ms response time? API timeout set to 5 seconds with exponential backoff retry (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s delays) before displaying error message.
- What occurs when malformed JSON responses are received from the fraud detection service? Client validates response schema and displays generic error message while logging full details for debugging.
- How does the system handle concurrent requests from the same user session? Debounce form submissions with 500ms delay and disable submit button during processing to prevent duplicate requests.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
