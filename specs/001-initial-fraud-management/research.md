# Research: Initial Fraud Management UI Implementation

**Feature**: Initial Fraud Management UI Implementation  
**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Research Phase**: Phase 0 - Technical Analysis

## Research Overview

This document consolidates technical research findings to resolve implementation unknowns and establish best practices for the fraud management UI implementation.

## Technical Stack Decisions

### Decision: React 18.x with Next.js 14.x Framework

**Rationale**:

- Next.js provides built-in performance optimizations (code splitting, image optimization, static generation)
- Server-side rendering capabilities for improved initial load times (<3s requirement)
- Built-in routing and API integration features
- Strong TypeScript support for type safety
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading and built-in linting

**Alternatives considered**:

- Pure React with Create React App: Rejected due to additional configuration overhead and performance limitations
- Vue.js with Nuxt.js: Rejected due to team familiarity and ecosystem maturity
- Angular: Rejected due to complexity overhead for single-page application requirements

### Decision: TypeScript 5.x for Type Safety

**Rationale**:

- Enhanced developer experience with compile-time error checking
- Better integration with fraud service API contracts (OpenAPI type generation)
- Improved maintainability for form validation and API response handling
- Constitutional requirement for enterprise-grade code quality

**Alternatives considered**:

- JavaScript only: Rejected due to lack of type safety for financial application
- Flow: Rejected due to declining community support and tooling

## Form Management and Validation

### Decision: React Hook Form with Zod Validation

**Rationale**:

- Minimal re-renders for better performance (critical for 100ms form validation requirement)
- Built-in form validation with excellent TypeScript support
- Zod provides runtime type validation aligned with fraud service API schema
- Strong accessibility support for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Excellent integration with custom input masking for credit card fields

**Alternatives considered**:

- Formik: Rejected due to performance overhead with frequent re-renders
- Native form handling: Rejected due to complexity of credit card masking and validation requirements

## API Integration Strategy

### Decision: Axios with React Query for HTTP Client

**Rationale**:

- React Query provides caching, background updates, and error handling
- Built-in retry logic for fraud service unavailability scenarios
- Request/response interceptors for authentication token management (future implementation)
- TypeScript support for API contract enforcement
- Performance optimization with request deduplication

**Alternatives considered**:

- Fetch API only: Rejected due to lack of built-in retry and caching mechanisms
- SWR: Rejected due to React Query's superior error handling for financial applications

## Credit Card Input Masking

### Decision: React Input Mask with Custom Luhn Validation

**Rationale**:

- Real-time masking during input (constitutional requirement)
- Maintains actual card number for validation while displaying masked version
- Custom Luhn algorithm implementation for client-side validation
- Accessibility compliant with screen reader announcements

**Alternatives considered**:

- Payment.js: Rejected due to external dependency security concerns
- Custom implementation only: Enhanced with proven masking library for reliability

## Testing Strategy Implementation

### Decision: Jest + React Testing Library + Cypress

**Rationale**:

- Jest for unit tests (70% coverage target) with excellent React integration
- React Testing Library for accessibility-focused component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end fraud verification workflow testing
- Built-in accessibility testing with axe-core integration
- Performance testing capabilities for 200ms response time validation

**Alternatives considered**:

- Vitest: Rejected due to team familiarity and established tooling
- Selenium: Rejected due to Cypress's superior developer experience and debugging

## Design System Integration

### Decision: GloboBank Design System v1.0+ with CSS Modules

**Rationale**:

- Constitutional requirement for brand consistency
- Component library provides pre-built accessible components
- Design tokens ensure consistent styling across fraud detection features
- CSS Modules prevent style conflicts while maintaining design system compliance

**Alternatives considered**:

- Styled Components: Rejected due to runtime performance overhead
- Tailwind CSS: Rejected due to design system compliance requirements

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Next.js Built-in Optimizations + Bundle Analysis

**Rationale**:

- Automatic code splitting for initial load time <3s
- Image optimization for brand assets
- Bundle analysis to maintain performance budgets
- Static generation for improved Time to Interactive <5s

**Implementation approach**:

- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Service worker for fraud service API caching
- Performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking

## Security Implementation (Initial Phase)

### Decision: Input Sanitization + HTTPS + CSP Headers

**Rationale**:

- XSS prevention through input validation and output encoding
- Credit card masking implementation protects sensitive data display
- Content Security Policy headers prevent injection attacks
- HTTPS enforcement for fraud service communication

**Future implementation ready**:

- OAuth 2.0 + PKCE integration points identified
- JWT token management strategy documented
- RBAC placeholder implementation prepared

## Development Environment

### Decision: Node.js 20.x LTS + pnpm Package Manager

**Rationale**:

- Node.js 20.x provides latest security updates and performance improvements
- pnpm reduces disk space usage and installation time
- Lockfile security for dependency integrity
- Built-in development server with hot module replacement

**Alternatives considered**:

- npm: Rejected due to slower installation and larger disk usage
- yarn: Rejected due to team standardization on pnpm

## Conclusion

All technical unknowns have been resolved with decisions based on:

- Constitutional compliance requirements
- Fraud service integration specifications
- Performance and security requirements
- Team expertise and long-term maintainability

Implementation is ready to proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts.
