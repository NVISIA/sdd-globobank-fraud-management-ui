- Polish & Integration: 13 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 25 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
**Test Tasks**: 14 tasks focused on testing (unit, integration, E2E)

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order**:

1. Setup & Foundation (required for all stories)
2. User Story 1 → Independent MVP delivery
3. User Story 2 → Can run in parallel with US3
4. User Story 3 → Can run in parallel with US2  
5. Polish & Integration (requires all stories complete)

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- **US1**: Fraud verification workflow completed in <30 seconds with <200ms response
- **US2**: Brand compliance validated with design system audit
- **US3**: Form validation prevents invalid submissions with clear error feedback

## Parallel Execution Examples

**Setup Phase** (can run T001-T008 in parallel):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Project setup
npm create next-app@14 . --typescript --tailwind --app

# Terminal 2: Install dependencies  
npm install react-hook-form zod axios @tanstack/react-query

# Terminal 3: Configure testing
npm install -D jest @testing-library/react cypress
```

**User Story 1 Implementation** (within story, some tasks can be parallel):

```bash
# Terminal 1: API service
# Implement src/services/fraudApi.ts

# Terminal 2: Custom hooks
# Implement src/hooks/useFraudAssessment.ts  

# Terminal 3: Unit tests
# Create src/services/__tests__/fraudApi.test.ts
```

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (T001-T029)

- Delivers core fraud verification functionality
- Can be deployed independently for immediate business value
- Provides foundation for iterative enhancement

**Incremental Delivery**:

1. **Week 1**: Setup + Foundation + User Story 1 (MVP)
2. **Week 2**: User Story 2 (Brand Experience)  
3. **Week 3**: User Story 3 (Enhanced Validation)
4. **Week 4**: Polish & Production Readiness

**Quality Gates**:

- 80% test coverage before each story completion
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation before story sign-off
- Performance targets met before production deployment
