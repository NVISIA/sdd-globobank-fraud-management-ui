# GloboBank Fraud Management UI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User Experience Excellence

All UI components and interactions must prioritize exceptional user experience while maintaining the balance between fraud prevention security and customer convenience. Every interface element must be intuitive, accessible, and designed to minimize friction for legitimate users while effectively presenting fraud alerts and risk indicators. User research and usability testing are mandatory for all major interface changes.

### II. Security by Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Security controls must be embedded into every UI component from inception. All authentication flows, data display, and user interactions must implement zero-trust principles with proper input validation, output encoding, and secure session management. UI components must never expose sensitive fraud detection logic or customer data without proper authorization and encryption.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD is mandatory for all UI components: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced with minimum 80% test coverage. Focus on unit tests (70%), integration tests (20%), and end-to-end tests (10%) following the test pyramid pattern.

### IV. Accessibility Compliance

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory for all UI components. Every interface must be fully accessible to users with disabilities through proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. Automated accessibility testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline with manual validation for critical user journeys.

### V. Design System Consistency

All UI components must adhere to the GloboBank Design System with consistent design tokens, component patterns, and interaction behaviors. No custom styling outside the design system without explicit approval. Design system updates must be implemented within one sprint cycle across all components.

### VI. Real-Time Fraud Integration

UI components must seamlessly integrate with real-time fraud detection systems to display risk indicators, fraud alerts, and security recommendations without compromising user experience. All fraud-related UI elements must be contextual, actionable, and provide clear guidance to users while maintaining appropriate security boundaries.

## Security Requirements

**Authentication & Authorization**: All user interfaces must implement OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for customer authentication and JWT tokens with RS256 signing for session management. Role-based access control (RBAC) must be enforced at the UI level with proper permission checks for fraud investigation tools and customer data access.

**Data Protection**: Customer data displayed in UI components must be masked, tokenized, or encrypted according to PCI-DSS requirements. Sensitive fraud detection data must never be exposed in client-side code, browser storage, or network requests without proper encryption and authorization.

**Input Validation**: All user inputs must be validated both client-side and server-side with proper sanitization to prevent XSS, injection attacks, and fraud bypass attempts. Special attention to fraud investigation forms, search queries, and configuration inputs.

**Session Security**: Implement secure session management with automatic timeout, secure cookie settings, and proper session invalidation. Fraud investigation sessions must have additional security controls including activity monitoring and enhanced logging.

**Compliance Standards**: UI components must support SOX compliance for financial reporting controls, GDPR for data protection, and financial industry standards (FFIEC, PCI-DSS). All fraud-related data handling must maintain comprehensive audit trails and regulatory reporting capabilities.

## Development Workflow

**Component Development**: All UI components must be developed as reusable, self-contained modules with comprehensive documentation, prop interfaces, and usage examples. Components must be framework-agnostic where possible and follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates).

**Testing Requirements**: Every component requires unit tests (Jest/Testing Library), visual regression tests (Storybook), accessibility tests (axe-core), and end-to-end tests for critical fraud workflows. Integration tests must validate fraud detection API integration and real-time data updates.

**Code Review Process**: All UI code changes require peer review with focus on accessibility compliance, security validation, design system adherence, and fraud domain logic verification. Reviews must include design approval for any visual changes and security approval for authentication/authorization modifications.

**Continuous Integration**: Automated CI/CD pipeline must include linting (ESLint), type checking (TypeScript), automated testing, accessibility validation, security scanning, and design system compliance checks. Failed quality gates block deployment to any environment.

**Performance Standards**: UI components must meet performance budgets including initial load time (<3s), Time to Interactive (<5s), and Cumulative Layout Shift (<0.1). Special attention to fraud detection dashboards and real-time data visualization performance under high transaction volumes.

## Governance

**Constitutional Authority**: This constitution supersedes all other development practices and coding standards for the GloboBank Fraud Management UI project. All pull requests, code reviews, and architectural decisions must verify compliance with these principles and requirements.

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional amendments require documentation of the change rationale, impact assessment, stakeholder approval from Product, Engineering, Security, and UX teams, and a migration plan for existing code. All amendments must maintain backward compatibility or provide explicit migration guidance.

**Compliance Verification**: All development activities must demonstrate adherence to constitutional principles through automated quality gates, peer reviews, and regular architecture reviews. Complexity beyond constitutional guidelines must be explicitly justified with business need and approved by the technical steering committee.

**Quality Gates**: No code may be deployed to production without passing all constitutional compliance checks including security validation, accessibility testing, design system compliance, fraud domain integration validation, and comprehensive test coverage requirements.

**Continuous Improvement**: Constitutional effectiveness is reviewed quarterly with metrics on code quality, security incidents, accessibility compliance, user experience satisfaction, and fraud detection integration performance. Updates are made based on lessons learned and evolving regulatory requirements.
