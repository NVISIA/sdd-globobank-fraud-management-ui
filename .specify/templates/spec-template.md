# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

---

## Constitutional Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Security Requirements

**Authentication & Authorization:**

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 + PKCE implementation required for customer authentication
- [ ] JWT tokens with RS256 signing for session management
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) for fraud investigation tools
- [ ] Specify which user roles can access which fraud data/features

**Data Protection:**

- [ ] Customer data masking/tokenization strategy per PCI-DSS
- [ ] Fraud detection data encryption requirements
- [ ] Specify what sensitive data cannot be exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Browser storage security requirements (no sensitive data in localStorage)

**Input Validation & Security:**

- [ ] Client-side and server-side input validation requirements
- [ ] XSS prevention measures for fraud investigation forms
- [ ] Injection attack prevention for search queries
- [ ] Session security: timeout, secure cookies, session invalidation

### Accessibility Requirements *(WCAG 2.1 AA - NON-NEGOTIABLE)*

**Screen Reader Compatibility:**

- [ ] All fraud alerts and risk indicators must be announced to screen readers
- [ ] Complex data visualizations require alternative text descriptions
- [ ] Form validation errors must be programmatically associable

**Keyboard Navigation:**

- [ ] All interactive elements accessible via keyboard only
- [ ] Logical tab order through fraud investigation workflows
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for frequent fraud investigation actions

**Visual Accessibility:**

- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet AA standards (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text)
- [ ] Information not conveyed by color alone (fraud risk indicators)
- [ ] Text scaling up to 200% without horizontal scroll

### UX Excellence Requirements

**User Research & Testing:**

- [ ] Usability testing required for fraud alert interfaces
- [ ] User journey validation for legitimate vs. suspicious activity flows
- [ ] Friction analysis: balance between security and user convenience
- [ ] Accessibility testing with assistive technology users

**Design System Compliance:**

- [ ] GloboBank Design System version: [specify version]
- [ ] All components must use approved design tokens
- [ ] Custom styling requires explicit approval
- [ ] Design consistency validation across fraud detection features

### Fraud Domain Integration

**Real-Time Features:**

- [ ] Risk indicator display requirements (real-time updates)
- [ ] Fraud alert notification system integration
- [ ] Transaction monitoring UI requirements
- [ ] Customer communication features for fraud verification

**Performance for Fraud Detection:**

- [ ] Real-time data update latency requirements
- [ ] Dashboard performance under high transaction volumes
- [ ] Alert response time requirements
- [ ] Fraud investigation tool performance standards
