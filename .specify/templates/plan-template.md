**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., TypeScript 5.x, React 18.x, Node.js 20.x or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., React, Next.js, Material-UI, Jest, Cypress or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**UI Framework**: [e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular, native web components or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Design System**: [GloboBank Design System compliance required - specify version or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Testing Strategy**: [Unit tests (70%), Integration tests (20%), E2E tests (10%) or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Modern browsers (Chrome 100+, Firefox 100+, Safari 15+), mobile-responsive or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [UI application - web/mobile determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [Initial load <3s, Time to Interactive <5s, CLS <0.1 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Accessibility**: [WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required, screen reader support or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Security Requirements**: [OAuth 2.0 + PKCE, JWT tokens, RBAC for fraud tools or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Fraud Integration**: [Real-time detection API, risk indicators, alert systems or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [e.g., concurrent users, transaction volume, fraud detection latency or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. User Experience Excellence**

- [ ] User research plan defined for major interface changes
- [ ] Usability testing strategy outlined
- [ ] Customer friction vs. fraud security balance addressed
- [ ] User journey mapping included for fraud scenarios

**II. Security by Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 + PKCE authentication strategy defined
- [ ] JWT token management approach specified
- [ ] Input validation and output encoding planned
- [ ] Fraud data protection measures outlined
- [ ] RBAC for fraud investigation tools defined

**III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

- [ ] TDD approach confirmed (tests → approval → fail → implement)
- [ ] Test pyramid strategy: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e
- [ ] Minimum 80% test coverage target set
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline planned

**IV. Accessibility Compliance**

- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance strategy defined
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility planned
- [ ] Keyboard navigation approach outlined
- [ ] Automated accessibility testing included in CI/CD

**V. Design System Consistency**

- [ ] GloboBank Design System version specified
- [ ] Component library usage planned
- [ ] Design token integration approach defined
- [ ] Design system compliance validation method outlined

**VI. Real-Time Fraud Integration**

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
